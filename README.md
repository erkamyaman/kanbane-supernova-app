# Kanbane Supernova ✨🌌

A lightweight, hobby **Kanban board** built from scratch — for my **personal usage**.  
I enjoy creating things myself instead of depending on third-party tools, so this project is both a learning exercise and a practical app I actually use.

## 🚀 Motivation
Building things from scratch is one of my hobbies.  
Rather than using existing Kanban tools, I wanted the freedom to customize and learn by coding my own. This way, I can fully control features and keep improving it as I like.

As an **Oasis fan**, this project is my little *"Wonderwall"* — something personal, built with passion, and always evolving.  
The name *Supernova* is a playful nod to *“Champagne Supernova”* 🌠.

## ✨ Features

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

## 🚧 Status
